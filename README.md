# Game Design Document

To complete part of the Required Medium Stake Assignment you must work towards creating or modifying an existing game design document (GDD). I have provided an example one from Unity and that can be found in the repository under the GDD Folder as a static exported document and/or you can create a copy of the live Google Document found in our [Class Google Drive-GDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15IQfQ7PugD2nLHvzLEx9tlCrE7JR6mDma_yTuxwdmoA/edit?usp=sharing). Please upload and submit your game design document before the deadline on the GitHub classroom schedule.

To complete the second part of the Required Medium State Assignment, you have to create and register an account with Unity3D, access the Unity Learning Environment, and finish the ['Develop your Learning Plan'](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/develop-your-learning-plan) tutorial.
